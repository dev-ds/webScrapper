# webScrapper
Scrap a website and get links of all the downloadable audio link

This is a web scrapper that will read through a webpage and collect all the downloadable links and store it in a text file.

I tried to learn from Bucky Roberts from TheNewBoston.com

All the program needs is the webpage that it needs to go through.

Currently I have dummied the sites so that.
