# webScrapper
Crawl a website and get links of all the downloadable links. We can modify the code to collect which specific download link you need.

This is a web scrapper that will read through a webpage and collect all the downloadable links and store it in a text file.

I tried to learn from Bucky Roberts from TheNewBoston.com

All the program needs is the webpage that it needs to go through.

Currently I have dummied the sites so that.
